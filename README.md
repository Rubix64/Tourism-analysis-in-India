Data analysis on tourism data obtained from [data.gov.in](http://data.gov.in)
         
          
To get a better experience of viewing the notebook, view it using:    
1. Jupyter lab:    
 Use the following commands:     
 Install it using:  `pip install jupyterlab`     
 Launch it using: `jupyter lab`
  
2. Google colab:
 Create an account in [colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) and access it.
 
 You can also use any other tools that'll help in viewing the `.ipynb` (Jupyter Source file) file.
         
          
 Before viewing the `.ipynb` file, do **clone the repository for the dataset**!!
            
           
To run the `.ipynb` file in jupyter labs, you will need to download `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` modules  using `pip`.    
Therefore it's best to view it in colabs as there won't be any installations required on your local machine.    
          
                   
**Have a good day ahead!!**
